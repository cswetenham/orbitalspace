DONE - Kepler orbits

Real units/constants

Camera - targeted, switching between targets (tab?) or free-roaming. 
- two aspects: camera position, camera direction

first/third person cams:
- at target, third-person, prograde direction/retrograde direction
- at target, third-person, +ve/-ve(?) direction (wrt parent body)
- at target, third-person, up/down direction (wrt parent body)
- at target, third-person, looking at target2
- at target, first-person, all of the above

overview cams:
keep some target in view
keep multiple targets in view
keep entire orbit of some target in view
keep entire orbit of multiple targets in view
keep multiple targets, entire orbits of other multiple targets, in view

mixed?
- at target1, first/third-person, keep entire orbit of target2/multiple targets in view


Add moon, earth-moon lagrange points? L points should come out of the sim ideally

Sphere of influence / patched conics

story/gameplay?

orbital police/enforcers? private/public?

how crowded is orbital space/various orbits?

how to chase, how to take down/capture?

Large nets between rockets - could surround target, but how would it force it to change orbit/immobilise
it once caught?

Lasers - have to keep in range/line of sight/firing arc for long enough

Kinectic slugs

Missiles

In real time, minutes or hours to respond to enemy orbit changes.

If see enemy can quickly estimate position, after a litte time velocity and thereby orbit

If see enemy burn can figure out new velocity, but also engine type, ship mass, etc.

If burn beyond horizon can make surprise/hidden orbit changes. The lower the orbit the easier it will be.

Scale of orbiting ships - satellites, modular stations, rotating stations, oneill cylinders?

Include normal traffic between orbit, landing and launching from surface of moon and earth?
