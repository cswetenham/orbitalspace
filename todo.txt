Kepler orbits

Add moon, earth-moon lagrange points? L points should come out of the sim ideally

Sphere of influence / patched conics

story/gameplay?

orbital police/enforcers? private/public?

how crowded is orbital space/various orbits?

how to chase, how to take down/capture?

Large nets between rockets - could surround target, but how would it force it to change orbit/immobilise
it once caught?

Lasers - have to keep in range/line of sight/firing arc for long enough

Kinectic slugs

Missiles

In real time, minutes or hours to respond to enemy orbit changes.

If see enemy can quickly estimate position, after a litte time velocity and thereby orbit

If see enemy burn can figure out new velocity, but also engine type, ship mass, etc.

If burn beyond horizon can make surprise/hidden orbit changes. The lower the orbit the easier it will be.

Scale of orbiting ships - satellites, modular stations, rotating stations, oneill cylinders?

Include normal traffic between orbit, landing and launching from surface of moon and earth?
